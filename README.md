<h1>User Experience (UX)</h1>

- First Time Visitor Goals
   
   a. As a First Time Visitor, I want to play a card matching game that helps to keep my memory skills sharp.

   b. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the game. 

   c. As a First Time Visitor, I want the game to function properly and easily work on all screen sizes.

- **Frequent User Goals**

- As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

- **Design**

- **Colour Scheme**

The two main colours used are teal and dark orchid in the animated gradient background. I chose this style as I wanted the background of the game
to match the theme of the cards and I chose to animate the gradient instead of originally going with a linear gradient in order to not completely
blend in with the images on the back of the card.

- **Typography**

The BioRhyme font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. BioRhyme seemed to fit the bohemian vibe I had intended for Align The Chakras.

- **Imagery**
The intention of the image on the back of the cards was to give a sense of magic, light, and mystery.

<h1>Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section</h1>

- **First Time Visitor Goals** 

- As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

- The game is very basic. There are no bells and whistles which makes it easier for a user to navigate.

- The main points are made immediately with the game grid image and header.

- The user only has one option, to click a card which begins the game

- <h3>Returning Visitor Goals</h3>

- -As a Returning Visitor, I want to get straight to the point and play the game. A "How To Play" Modal and start button would be nice to have.

- The game board works properly, meaning each cards clicks and flips over smoothly. I would like to have enough time to mentally calcuate the displayed image and remember the proper placement for future matching. 
 
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

Upon entering the page, the game is immediately up and the cards are waiting to be clicked. 
Once the cards have all been matched, a victory screen appears letting the user know they have won with a "play again" button. 

<h3>Further Testing</h3>

The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Bing, browsers.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
The game was tested by friends and family.

<h1>Known Bugs</h1>

- The first major bug in Align The Chakras is that upon winning the game, the shuffle function breaks which renders the second game useless.

- The second major bug is again, after the first win, the victory screen fails to reappear. 

- On some browsers like Safari, it seems two of the bottom two cards turn blue. 

- In some instances, the cards that have already been flippied can be clicked back over which breaks the logic early on and the victory screen appears earlier.

- If the game has been won once, the victory screen will not appear a second time.



<h1>Deployment</h1>

Align The Chakras has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

All code was written on Gitpod, a cloud-based IDE.

The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my Repository.

Under the Settings section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to GitHub Pages section.

Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.

Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

The code can be run locally through clone or download. You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.

The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine or uploaded to your cloud-based IDE workspace.
